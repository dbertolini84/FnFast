# FnFast
# framework to compute diagrams in SPT and EFTofLSS for cosmology

This package computes objects in cosmology that can be represented as diagrams.
The code is set up so that additional diagrams need only be specified in terms of their topology, 
and the value of the diagram is computed once the topology is specified.  
The transition to automatic generation of allowed topologies should be straightforward, 
and will likely happen in later stages of development.
